-- If that function returns a payload, it is set at that point, if it returns Nothing then it's deleted (Or left empty if it never existed)

-- This function takes a label and a list of children and builds a Node out of it
-- That's not all, though.
-- It also takes a k and an r and creates subdivisions and tests them, to see if they are instantiable
-- It also checks itself, and either returns an Instantiable node or a NonInstantiable as necessary
-- While this node itself may be Instantiable or not, with a steady-state it should be the case that every node under this one should be either Instantiable or Leaf.
